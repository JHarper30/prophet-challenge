Module 8 Challenge
This project was evaluating as a growth analyst for Mercado Libre, and evaluating search patterns in traffic history answering questions and then modeling out what the future of the search Traffic could look like.

I looked for patterns in the hourly search data, and then at how the search traffic data had any correlation to stock prices and measured that with Stock Valtility.

Then moved on to Time series modeling with Prophet to see what the forecasts would look like.
